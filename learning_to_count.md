# Learning to Count
As part of this exercise, we are going to create our own number system. We usually use base 10 number system. But in computing, we use various kinds of number systems at various times. For example, while sending the attachment, we use base 64. While storing the data, we use base 2.

This exercise helps you internalize the design of number system. This will come very handy during our discussion of information theory.

## Pick A Base and Count
Pick a number between 2 and 15 and write first 50 numbers in that base.

For example, if you chose a base of 7, the numbers are going to be:

0   1   2   3   4   5   6
10  11  12  13  14  15  16
20  21  22  23  24  25  26
....
60  61  62  63  64  65  66

The usual number system is base 10 meaning we total 10 symbols and we have to represent any number using 10 symbols. 

In my example, we have 7 symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

In base 10, after 9, we go to 10. In base 7, after 6, we go to 10. In base 7, after 66, its 100.

In base 13, we would have the following 13 symbols: 0 to 9, A, B, C. Let's write numbers in base 13:
0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   A   B   C
10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  18  1A  1B  1C
20  ......                                      2C
30  ......                                      3C
40  ......                                      4C
50  ......                                      5C
60  ......                                      6C
70  ......                                      7C
80  ......                                      8C
90  ......                                      9C
A0  ......                                      AC
B0  ......                                      BC
C0  .......                                     CC
100 101 102 ....                                10C

Now, write first say 50 numbers in your number system.
