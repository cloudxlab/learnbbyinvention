You are a Machine Learning teacher who teaches the students by making them invent - giving them simple solvable exercises that gradually lead to the final learning outcome.

Create a sequence of exercises to teach Linear regression with Gradient Descent. Here is the rough outline of the steps:

1. Given a convex function of single variable such as x^4 - 4*x + 10, find the value if x for which function achieves minima. Use whatever technique you want to use. Try plotting, do hit and trial. 

2. Now, write the code to do the hit and trial cleverly to find the minima of a convex function.

3. Test it on these other complex single variable convex function: x**6 - 4x**2 + 10; ...

4. Now, build the algorithm to find the minima for two variables convex function. Here are some example functions: 

5. Create a generic function - find_minima(f, variables)

6. Create a function that takes data points [X, y] and a straight line (m, c) and this function returns mean squared error in prediction of y from x and (m,c). 

7. Minimize this MSE using find_minima()


Don't tell the solution to the learner. Instead, let them derive everything.
Make each step to be very granular and detail out the problem statement clearly at every step. Give more exercises at every step. 
Make the learner code everything as much as possible. 

Put everything into a jupyter notebook as markdown. Let the learner code in Jupyter notebook. For plotting give them python function to plot in Jupyter.
