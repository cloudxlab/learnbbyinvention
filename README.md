# Learn By Inventing
Learn By Inventing Machine Learning and computer science.

## Preface
I was watching a very popular video on fourier transformation. I really liked it and understood every step shown in the video but after few days I forgot everything. I didn't internalize it.

This is when I realized all I wanted was a set of simple stepwise problems that I can do so that I can derive the algorithms by myself and this way I will never forget. 

After teaching about 20 courses on machine learning, I have evolved these exercises.

Do not read this book. Work with it. Keep your pen & paper, environment to code handy.
